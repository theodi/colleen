    <p>We Need Us (&quot;the Work&quot;) contains many components.</p>
    <p>It is important to understand that just because something is online does not make it &quot;free&quot;. And equally, just because you can say &quot;it’s open&quot;, doesn’t necessarily give people certainty that they can re-use it, or if by &quot;open&quot; you mean &quot;free&quot;. These ideas have been the subject of much <a rel="license" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre" target="_blank">debate</a> in software.</p>
    <p>There are clear licensing mechanisms for different content types, and it is important to pro-actively license works to be free, or restricted accordingly. We also wish highlight the complexity in copyright and licensing, as new technology creates new complexity: for example, what is the status of a partially-computer-generated image in relationship to  semi-causal influence via networked data (as is the case in this work)? How would you define the &quot;complete work&quot; given it combines creative concepts, technical concepts, architecture, code, design, data, databases, algorithms, images, sounds, and animation – and constantly changes over time? We have taken a variety of approaches here to illustrate these challenges.</p>
    <p>All text content, rendered static images and sound samples, database, and data in the Work are licensed under a <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License</a>. The full legal license can be read <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode" target="_blank">here</a>. All relevant data specifically derived and/or produced for the Work will be published with an Open Data Certificate. We will continue to assess if the &quot;NonCommercial&quot; condition here is desirable in the context of this specific work.</p>
    <p>All code pertaining to the Work is <a href="https://github.com/theodi/colleen" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a> under an MIT open source license, aligned with <a rel="license" href="https://github.com/theodi/ODI/blob/master/charter/standards.md" target="_blank">ODI Standards</a>. This license applies to the visual and sonic rendering code, and deployment code therein.</p>
    <p>Third party rights such as, but not limited to, Zooniverse data, may apply and will be marked accordingly.</p>
